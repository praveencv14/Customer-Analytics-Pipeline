Batch (legacy transactions):

AWS: Source DB → AWS DMS (CDC) → S3 (Parquet) → Snowflake Snowpipe auto-ingest → RAW.ORDERS/PRODUCTS/CUSTOMERS.

Azure: Source DB → Azure Data Factory → ADLS Gen2 → Event Grid → Snowpipe → RAW.*.

OCI: Source DB → OCI Data Integration / GoldenGate → OCI Object Storage → Snowpipe → RAW.*.

Real-time (clickstream):

Web/App → Kinesis or Kafka → Snowpipe Streaming (or Kafka Connector) → RAW.CLICKS_STREAM.

Optional enrichment with Flink/Kinesis Analytics.

Transform & Orchestrate:

dbt: RAW → STAGING → ANALYTICS (tests + docs).

Airflow: schedules, backfills, DQ, alerts.

Cost & freshness: Parquet, auto-suspend warehouses, right-size compute; use streaming for sub-minute click freshness, daily/batch for ERP stability.
