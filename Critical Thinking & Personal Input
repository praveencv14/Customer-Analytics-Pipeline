Where I added unique value (specific challenges & fixes):

Secrets & profiles: AI’s examples hardcoded creds.
My fix: Env-var driven config; .gitignore for secrets; production note to use Airflow Connections.
Reasoning: Security-by-default, CI/CD ready.

Deterministic DAG: AI DAG lacked robust ordering & failure behavior.
My fix: Explicit ingest → dbt → DQ → complete chain with testable PythonOperator for DQ.
Reasoning: Easier debugging, safer remediation slot.

Outlier method choice: AI leaned to z-score.
My fix: IQR per product + median imputation.
Reasoning: Robust for skew; transparent for stakeholders.

Referential integrity policy:
My fix: Alert + quarantine invalid rows instead of failing pipeline.
Reasoning: Keeps analytics usable; issues are visible and traceable.

Measure consistency:
My fix: Compute extended_amount in dbt and persist in fact.
Reasoning: Single source of truth across tools.
